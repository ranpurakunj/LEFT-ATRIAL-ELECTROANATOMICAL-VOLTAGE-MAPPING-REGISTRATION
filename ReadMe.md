Dataset used was Patient Data provided along with project material. It consisted of comma seperated values 
of x, y and z co-ordinates, bipolar and unipolar values and x, y and z normalized forms of those co-ordinates over the 
patient's pericardium.

We converted this data in to Object File Format which gives a better idea of how the point cloud data 
would be rendered into the 3D mesh. This off files were then used for the registration of the point clouds 
over randomly chosen template.

Classification for the AF-type and recurrence AF was unsuccessful.

## Modifications to the code:



## Test Results:

Test Results are saved in testresults2 directory. It contains various log files, path files and images 
directory which consist of various registration images of the dataset.
